#  Kariyer.net Clone ‚Äì Job Search Platform

This project is a modern, full-stack **Job Search Web Application** inspired by kariyer.net, built with a service-oriented architecture. The platform enables users to search and apply for jobs, track recent searches, receive notifications, and interact with an AI job assistant for smart job suggestions.

React Frontend: Handles job browsing, filters, detail views, and AI chat.

API Gateway: Central request router and security proxy.

Admin Service: Admin-only endpoints to add or update job posts.

Job Posting Service: Stores job details, application count, related jobs (MongoDB + Redis).

Job Search Service: Enables keyword/city search, autocomplete, filters, and search history.

Notification Service: Handles job alerts via RabbitMQ and MongoDB.

AI Agent Service: Uses Together.ai to interpret user intent and return job matches.

## How to Run Locally
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Sehrank8/4458FinalProject
cd 4458Final

# Start Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# Run API Gateway
cd ../api-gateway
npm install
node index.js

# Run Spring Boot microservices
cd ../admin-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../job-search-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../job-posting-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../notification-service
mvn spring-boot:run

cd ../ai-agent-service
node agent.js
## AI Message Format
Frontend sends:

json
{
  "text": "show me remote Java jobs in Ankara",
  "userId": "user123"
}
Agent returns:

json
{
  "reply": [
    {
      "title": "Java Developer",
      "location": "Ankara",
      "applyUrl": "/job/abc123"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
## Design Decisions
Used MongoDB for flexibility in job postings and alert storage

Integrated Redis to cache job details for faster response

Utilized RabbitMQ to decouple alert processing

Designed REST APIs for job CRUD, search, detail, apply

Used Together.ai to parse free-text job queries into structured API calls

## Known Issues
Render free-tier may cause cold starts/delays

AI rate limit: fallback response used if Together.ai times out

Some endpoints require JWT ‚Äì use login form or Postman to obtain token
